        <p>
          Tagged the father of nationalism, Herbert Macaulay was one of the key figures who helped the modern Nigeria.
        </p> <br/>

        <p>
          During the 1920s when Nigeria started to witness the political agitation for self-rule, Macaulay was among the first generation of Nigerian Nationalists who protested against some policies introduced by the British colonial rule, including water rates, land issues, and management of railway finances.
        </p> <br/>
        
        <p>
          It was during that time, in 1923, that he founded the Nigeria National Democratic Party(NNDP), Nigeria’s first political party whose members were the first to sit in the legislative council and which held sway in Nigeria’s political theatre until the late 1930s when it joined forces with the Nigeria Youth Movement to form the National Council of Nigeria and the Cameroons (NCNC), a nationalist organization designed to advocate for Nigeria’s independence.
